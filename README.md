# Embeded Standard Setting

This repository has codes that implement several Embedded Standard Setting (ESS) methods(Lewis & Cook, 2020). 
ESS is a new standard new standard setting methodology designed to calculate cut scores through the optimization of the relationship between item alignment to Achievement Level Descriptors (ALDs) and item difficulty. 


## Description

The codes in this repository implement three ESS methods: 
1) maximize the agreement between rater assigned item achievement levels and ESS-determined item achievemnet levels,
2) Mean & Midpoint method (First, calculate the mean difficulty for items at each performance level. Subsequently, cut scores are determined by locating the midpoints between the mean values of adjacent levels.)
3) Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve method (identify the cut that optimze prediction by striking a balance between true positives and true negatives).
